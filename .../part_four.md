                                                            ### PART FOUR OF CHALLENGE

### Task 1: Understanding Decimal Operations

- **Task 027:** Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a number with lots of decimal places, multiplies it by two, and displays the answer.

- **Task 028:** Extend Task 027 by updating the program to display the answer to two decimal places.

### Task 2: Mathematical Operations

- **Task 029:** Create a Python program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 500, calculates the square root of that number, and displays it to two decimal places.

- **Task 030:** Write a program to display the mathematical constant Pi (π) to five decimal places.

### Task 3: Geometry Calculations

- **Task 031:** Develop a program that asks the user to enter the radius of a circle, calculates the area of the circle (π * radius^2), and displays the result.

- **Task 032:** Build a Python program that asks for the radius and depth of a cylinder and calculates the total volume (circle area * depth). Round the result to three decimal places.

### Task 4: Integer Division and Remainders

- **Task 033:** Create a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, performs whole number division to divide the first number by the second, and calculates the remainder. Display the result in a user-friendly way (e.g., "7 divided by 2 is 3 with 1 remaining" for inputs 7 and 2).

### Task 5: Shape Area Calculator

- **Task 034:** Design a menu-driven program that asks the user to choose between two shapes: square or triangle. 
    - If the user selects 1 (square), ask for the length of one of its sides and display the area.
    - If the user selects 2 (triangle), ask for the base and height of the triangle and display the area.
    - For any other input, provide a suitable error message.

Happy learning!

### Python Challenge Part Two

## Task 012

In this task, you'll be asking the user for two numbers. If the first number is larger than the second one, you need to display the second number first, followed by the first number. If the first number is not larger than the second, display the first number first, followed by the second number.

## Task 013

For this task, your goal is to prompt the user to enter a number that is under 20. If the number they enter is 20 or more, you should display the message "Too high." Otherwise, display the message "Thank you."

## Task 014

In this task, you'll ask the user to input a number between 10 and 20 (inclusive). If the number they enter falls within this range, display the message "Thank you." Otherwise, show the message "Incorrect answer."

## Task 015

This task involves asking the user to input their favorite color. If they enter "red," "RED," or "Red," display the message "I like red too." Otherwise, display the message "I donâ€™t like [color], I prefer red."

## Task 016

For this task, you'll need to ask the user if it's raining. Convert their answer to lowercase so that the case doesn't matter. If they answer "yes," ask them if it's windy. If they answer "yes" to the second question, display "It is too windy for an umbrella." Otherwise, display "Take an umbrella." If they didn't answer "yes" to the first question, simply display "Enjoy your day."

## Task 017

In this task, you'll be asking the user's age. Based on their age, display different messages:
- If they're 18 or over: "You can vote."
- If they're 17: "You can learn to drive."
- If they're 16: "You can buy a lottery ticket."
- If they're under 16: "You can go Trick-or-Treating."

Remember, the goal is to create a program that interacts with the user and provides appropriate responses based on their input. Good luck, and keep building your DevOps skills!

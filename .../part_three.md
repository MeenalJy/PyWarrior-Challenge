###  Python Challenge Part Three 

## Task 020: Calculate Name Length
**Description:** In this task, you'll ask the user to enter their first name and then display the length of their name.

## Task 021: Combine First Name and Surname
**Description:** In this task, you'll ask the user to enter their first name and surname separately. Then, you'll join them together with a space between and display the full name along with its length.

## Task 022: Title Case Full Name
**Description:** For this task, you'll ask the user to enter their first name and surname in lowercase. You'll need to change the case of the names to title case and then join them together. Finally, display the result.

## Task 023: Extract Text Section
**Description:** In this task, you'll ask the user to input the first line of a nursery rhyme. Then, you'll ask for a starting and ending number. You'll display the section of the text based on the given range. Remember that Python starts counting from 0.

## Task 024: Convert to Uppercase
**Description:** Here, you'll ask the user to input any word and then display the word in uppercase.

## Task 025: Manipulate First Name
**Description:** In this task, you'll ask the user to enter their first name. If the length of their first name is under five characters, you'll prompt them to enter their surname. You'll then join the first name and surname (without a space) and display the full name in uppercase. If the length of the first name is five or more characters, you'll display the first name in lowercase.

## Task 026: Pig Latin Conversion
**Description:** In this final task, you'll implement a Pig Latin conversion. If a word begins with a consonant, you'll move the first consonant to the end of the word and add "ay". If the word begins with a vowel, you'll simply add "way" to the end. You'll prompt the user to enter a word and then display the Pig Latin version of that word in lowercase.

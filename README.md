# PyWarrior Challenges 
Welcome to my PyWarrior Challenges repository! 


This repository documents my journey of learning Python through hands-on practice. I'm following the "Python with Example" book and solving problems to strengthen my Python skills. As of now, I've completed 25 out of the 150 problems in the book. Each challenge is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Use

If you're also interested in learning Python or want to follow my progress, you can navigate through the repository and explore the solutions I've come up with. For each problem, there is a corresponding folder containing a Python script that shows how to solve it.
To try out a solution:
1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. Navigate to the specific problem's folder.
3. Open the Python script in your preferred editor or IDE.
4. Run the script to see the solution in action.

Feel free to provide feedback, suggest improvements, or contribute additional solutions to any of the problems!

## Contributions

I welcome contributions from fellow Python enthusiasts! If you've found a more efficient solution to a problem or want to add your own problems to this repository, feel free to open a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!

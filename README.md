## Introduction

This repository presents a series of Python programming challenges, each designed to test and improve your Python programming skills. The challenges cover different topics, from basic user input and output to mathematical calculations and conversions.

## Challenges

1. [Ask for the User's First Name](challenge_part_one.ipynb)
   - Description: Prompt the user for their first name and display a greeting message.
   - Implementation: Python code using the `input()` function for user input and `print()` function for output.

2. [Ask for First Name and Surname](challenge_part_one.ipynb)
   - Description: Prompt the user for their first name and surname, then display a personalized welcome message.
   - Implementation: Python code using multiple `input()` and `print()` statements.

3. [Joke Display](challenge_part_one.ipynb)
   - Description: Display a joke and its answer on separate lines.
   - Implementation: Python code using a single `print()` statement with escape characters.

4. [Add Two Numbers](challenge_part_one.ipynb)
   - Description: Ask the user to enter two numbers, add them together, and display the sum.
   - Implementation: Python code using `input()` for number input, basic arithmetic operations, and `print()` for output.

5. [Calculate with Three Numbers](challenge_part_one.ipynb)
   - Description: Ask the user to enter three numbers, add the first two, and then multiply the total by the third number. Display the answer.
   - Implementation: Python code with multiple `input()` statements and arithmetic calculations.

6. [Calculate Pizza Slices](challenge_part_one.ipynb)
   - Description: Ask the user for the total number of pizza slices and the number of slices they have eaten. Calculate and display the remaining slices.
   - Implementation: Python code using `input()` for number input and basic arithmetic operations.

7. [Calculate Age on Next Birthday](challenge_part_one.ipynb)
   - Description: Ask the user for their name and age, add 1 to their age, and display the output.
   - Implementation: Python code using `input()` for user input, arithmetic operation, and `print()` for output.

8. [Split the Bill](challenge_part_one.ipynb)
   - Description: Ask the user for the total bill and the number of diners, then calculate and display how much each person must pay.
   - Implementation: Python code using `input()` for number input, division, and `print()` for output.

9. [Convert Days to Hours, Minutes, and Seconds](challenge_part_one.ipynb)
   - Description: Ask the user for a number of days and calculate how many hours, minutes, and seconds are in that number.
   - Implementation: Python code using `input()` for number input and arithmetic operations.

10. [Convert Weight from Kilograms to Pounds](challenge_part_one.ipynb)
    - Description: Ask the user for their weight in kilograms and convert it to pounds.
    - Implementation: Python code using `input()` for number input and conversion formula.

11. [Calculate Smaller Number Division](challenge_part_one.ipynb)
    - Description: Ask the user to enter a number over 100 and a number under 10. Calculate how many times the smaller number goes into the larger number.
    - Implementation: Python code using `input()` for number input and division calculation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks to view and run the Python code for each challenge.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to complete each challenge.
4. Modify the code or experiment with different scenarios to test your skills.

Happy coding!

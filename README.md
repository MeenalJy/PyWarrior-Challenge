# PyWarrior Challenges - Leveling Up My Python Skills

Welcome to my PyWarrior Challenges repository! Here, I've been working on a series of Python programming challenges to improve my coding skills. Each challenge is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook.

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to my journey of mastering Python programming. I've been taking on various challenges that cover different concepts, from basic user input and output to conditional statements. Let's see what I've accomplished so far!

## Challenges
### Part One - Basics
1. **Ask for the User's First Name**
   - Description: Prompt the user for their first name and display a greeting message.
   - Implementation: Python code using the `input()` function for user input and `print()` function for output.

2. **Ask for First Name and Surname**
   - Description: Prompt the user for their first name and surname, then display a personalized welcome message.
   - Implementation: Python code using multiple `input()` and `print()` statements.

3. **Joke Display**
   - Description: Display a joke and its answer on separate lines.
   - Implementation: Python code using a single `print()` statement with escape characters.

... (and so on for challenges 4 to 11, refer to previous README for details)

### Part Two - If Statement
12. **Comparing Two Numbers**
    - Description: Ask for two numbers. If the first one is larger than the second, display the second number first and then the first number. Otherwise, show the first number first and then the second.
    - Implementation: Python code using `input()` for number input, conditional `if-else` statements, and `print()` for output.

13. **Check Number Range**
    - Description: Ask the user to enter a number that is under "20". If they enter a number that is 20 or more, display the message ‚ÄúToo high‚Äù. Otherwise, display ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù.
    - Implementation: Python code using `input()` for number input, a conditional `if` statement, and `print()` for output.

14. **Check Number Range (Extended)**
    - Description: Ask the user to enter a number between 10 and 20 (inclusive). If they enter a number within this range, display the message ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù. Otherwise, display the message ‚ÄúIncorrect answer‚Äù.
    - Implementation: Python code using `input()` for number input, logical operators, and `print()` for output.

... (and so on for challenges 15 to 19, refer to the provided JSON for code details)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks to view and run the Python code for each challenge.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to complete each challenge.
4. Modify the code or experiment with different scenarios to test your skills.
5. Enjoy the process of learning and improving your Python skills!

Happy coding! üíªüöÄ
